Outside Sales Professional,Sales,Terminix,Auburn,AL,US,2020-11-04,"<div id=""jobDescriptionText"" class=""jobsearch-jobDescriptionText""><div>
<p>For more than 85 years, Terminix has built a reputation as one of the nation’s leading providers of termite and pest control services, safeguarding over 3 million homes and businesses against all types of pests in 47 states and 14 countries.

<p><b>What does a “Day-in-the-Life” look like?
</b></p>
<p>Equipped with a company vehicle and excellent industry training, our Sales Reps are out in the communities Terminix serves meeting with new and existing customers. Sales appointments are typically pre-arranged with customers who have already expressed a need, giving a head start on the selling process. Your visit would typically begin with an inspection of the home to diagnose the issue (which may include getting in attics and crawlspaces) and be followed by a presentation of a recommended Service Plan to the customer.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here are a few additional details of what you would be doing each day:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Documenting descriptions of property and recording accurate measurements of areas inspected

<p><b>What do I need to be successful?
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Being a high school graduate/having a GED and a valid driver’s license are both requirements
</li>
<li>6 to 12 months of sales experience or prior sales training is highly desired, but not required
</li>
<li>You are highly motivated, have a strong work ethic and enjoy the selling process
</li>
<li>You are able to build rapport easily and establish trust, leading to lasting customer relationships
</li>
<li>You have strong communications skills – impersonal, written, presenting
</li>
<li>You can effectively present information to customers one-on-one and in small groups
</li>
<li>You have a good aptitude for basic math- necessary for doing calculations related to the sales process
</li>
<li>Of course, given our business and the nature of this role, you should be comfortable working outside and in confined spaces like crawl spaces and attics
</li>
<li>For safety reasons (rebreathers have be able to seal to your face) our Outside Sales Professionals aren’t able to have facial hair
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why should I choose Terminix?
</b></p>
<p>In addition to being part of an iconic brand with a rich 85 year history, here are some other highlights of what we offer members of the Terminix Team.
